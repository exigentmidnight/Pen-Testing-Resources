This is a list of resources that I've encountered or discovered that relate to different phases of a pen test. Eventually I'll add in more phases as I consolidate my notes from different platforms. Please note that inclusion in any lists here is not an endorsement or indication of usefulness.

Current phases that I'm focused on are:
1. [Planning/Reporting](planning_reporting.md)
1. [Training](training.md)
1. [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance.md)
